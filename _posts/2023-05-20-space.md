<font size=6><p>Making a cubesat is a complex ngineering task. It requires high analytical and design thinking, moreover working in a big team can sometimes be confusing. In this project I designed the EPS system for a 6U satellite carrying a payload to detect pulsars in the deep space. We worked in a small teams of 3 but we had around 8 subteams working simultaneously on other areas of the satellite. It was a learning experience working in a big team and updating our deliverables each week to keep up with other sub-teams.

<p><font size=6>My initial bias was to work on GNSS and automation team, but with the strong love for electronics I have it was a better option. Also I had more time to make valuable contributions apart from learning new things. Although I enjoyed working on the thermal aspects for the cubesat as well. Making sure the power budget compensated for all phases when the heater is used and also delivered during other phases of the mission was critical.</p></font>

<p>The report does more justice to the technical aspects of the project. Please read it for more thorough insights, not only with regards to EPS system but also with regards to the amazing work done by my teammates and other sub teams.</p>
