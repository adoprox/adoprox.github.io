<font size=6><p>SDN or Software defined networking is a technology that enables separating the control plane and data plane for a network. SDN grants us the access to program the control plane and push the development for more virtual networks. it is core for the 5th generation of mobile networks or 5G.</p>

<p>My small contribution in this area was an effort to understand how SDN works and in what ways we can implement it. My application is a simple authentication for virtual hosts and enable security in a virtual network. In this post we will go through the technologies used and the understanding of the underlying technologies and how they all work together. On my github you can also explore the source code and make your own contributions to grow the project.</p>

<p>
First we will discuss the underlying technologies that are used to make this application work. To create virtual networks we use mininet and to implement a SDN authority over the control plane we use a very well known open source controller called Open Network Operating System or <a href="https://opennetworking.org/onos/">ONOS</a>. Feel free to read about ONOS and its functionalities using the link provided. This controller is what makes everything function and is the governing authority over control plane for the virtual network initialized using mininet. The remaining part of the application is the authentication where we use a micro-webframework called <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/"> Flask </a>.

<font size=6><p>I used Flask to render the front end used for authentication. As both the ONOS server and Flask server are running locally on different ports, we use the REST API exposed by ONOS to manipulate JSON packets that change the flows. Flows are technically the rules that define how the network communicates. As we authenticate each host the flows are changed and they are able to communicate over the network. A detailed report is uploaded on my github that explains the testing and the source code for this application. </p></font>

<font size=6><p>My key takeaway from this project was to learn about SDN. Ideally the use of Java is dominant in networking domain but with a little understanding of the controller and after reading about REST APIs, I was able to use python and make it work. ONOS is a very powerful controller generally used by big organizations to monitor and alter their network, the pre-requisite is a little understanding about networking. This project was really fun and development using ONOS gets very handy when using the tools provided by the organization. A good suite of UI tools and monitoring application makes testing really easy, moreover the <a href="https://wiki.onosproject.org/">wiki</a> is very well written and dispense some amazing links to work with. I personally used <a href="http://mininet.spear.narmox.com/">this tool</a> to visualize and understand networks created using mininet. </p>

I really wish to integrate this solution with UAVs. I see a great potential of using SDN based devices to achieve the goals of a UTM. UTM do span over a large variety of services and I think many such services can be developed using these tools and right understanding.
