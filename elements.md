					<h3>X-ray image segementation using DL NN</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This is one of the most interesting projects I've worked on. Diving into the world of DL and AI was really interesting. Here I've used UNET architecture for semantic segmentation of electrodes in a battery technology. I've had tons of help from my teammates and the results are explored on my github. </p>

					<h3>Football match predictions using ODDS</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In this project I worked with pandas and sklearn to explore this very popular citi bike dataset. I worked with a prediction model to predict the number of pickups and later generated a heatmap for pickups and drop-offs for a monthly period. The visualization part was really insightful as the code generates interactive maps using folium for each month. </p>
